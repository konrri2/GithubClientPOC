# GithubClientPOC
##Simple iOS app to list, search and display details of GitHub users


NOTE: The `SecretSettings.swift` file with `globalApiToken` is not pushed to repo
Please provide github api token
I've hardcoded token to safe time.
In production app I would use arkana https://github.com/rogerluan/arkana
